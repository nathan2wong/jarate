    In order to optmize the most efficient Red and Green values from User input. A and B are the user variables while x is the x coordinate to which the user coordinates are closest to the reference curve.
Math Calculations:
    (d)/(dx)((a-(483.17 ln(x)-2417.4))^2+(b-x)^2) = -(966.34 (a-483.17 ln(x)+2417.4))/x-2 b+2 x = 0 <!--add math text later -->
    This is equal to:
    -(966.34 a)/x-2 b+2 x-(2.33603Ã—10^6)/x+(466906. ln(x))/x  = 0
